Redesign the Scottish Hindu Foundation (SHF) website  to enhance user experience and functionality while maintaining the essence of the  organization's identity. The redesigned website will feature new key components: a donation platform to facilitate contributions. Additionally, existing sections such as Home, About Us, Events, Gallery, Contact, and Work With Us will remain, ensuring continuity for regular visitors while offering improved features.
